# GAN vs VAE on MNIST dataset
## CAP6610 - Final Project

## Details about Files
* Autoencoder.ipynb - Variational AutoEncoder
* GAN.ipynb - Generative Adversarial Network

## Instruction for Running
I ran the code on Google Colaboratory due to lack of GPU support on my personal system. To check, the two files can be downloaded, and tested individually by simply running them in Google Colabs at separate instances. They do not require any additional dependencies on the host machine like python, tensorflow or other libraries as these are already installed in Colabs.
