# GAN vs VAE on MNIST dataset
## CAP6610 - Final Project

## Details about Files
* Autoencoder.ipynb - Variational AutoEncoder
* GAN.ipynb - Generative Adversarial Network

## Instruction for Running
I ran the code on Google Colaboratory due to lack of GPU support on my personal system. This can be tested by downloading these files and simply running them in Google Colabs. They do not require any additional dependencies.
